We are [R-Ladies Paris](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-paris/), a network of R practitioners in Paris. We are a local chapter of a global open source community promoting gender inclusivity among R practitioners and learners, [R-Ladies Global](https://rladies.org/).

Our goals are to provide a supportive and encouraging network for R users who identify as female and to promote learning and collaboration in the R community. We are open to anyone interested in programming in R, from experts to novices.

Anyone worldwide with an interest in R is encouraged to participate!
